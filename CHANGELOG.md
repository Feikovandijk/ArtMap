* Eye Dropper now prints out base dye plus the byte code for easier shade matching on other eisels.
* Fixed mismatch by making Coarse Dirt -> Podzol.

## Release 3.3.0
### Major Changes
* Paint Bukkit is no longer craftable.  
    - Instead use a regular bukkit in the main hand the dye you want to fill with in the offhand.
    - There have been too many exploits with the crafting of paint bukkets and duplicating items this neatly removes that problem.
    - Now allows players in creative mode to more easily use paint buckets without leaving the easel to craft them.
* Added Eye Dropper Tool.
    - Using a sponge left click the colour you would like to pick up. Then right click to draw with the color.
    - Allows easy copy of shades.
    - Usable with the paint bucket to fill with a shade.
* Admin's can now right click dyes in the dye menu to receive a copy of the dye.
* Players can now obtain a copy of their own artwork by right clicking on it in the preview menu.  It cost them one empty map just like using a crafting table would.

### Minor Changes
* Lots of cleanup to the English Language file.
    - Try to make sure tooltips won't go off screen even on huge GUI configurations.
    - Made more text able to be changed via the language files.
    - If you are using a custom lang.yml I suggest comparing to the new lang.yml to pickup changes.
    - If anyone has updates to the other languages files please sumbit an issue and I will have the updated or added as soon as possible.
* Fixed help menu back buttons sometimes being invisible.
* Fixed a few duplication and stealing from artkit bugs.
* Add '/art break' if a player really wants to break and easel and reset the artwork.
    - Prevents accidental easel breaks.
