## Move to Gitlab
I've moved this project to gitlab https://gitlab.com/BlockStack/ArtMap.  Mirroring has been setup so all commits should be available to fork on github.  But please submit issues on Gitlab.

### Attribution
This is not my original work and belongs to Fupery.  I continue maintenance of this plugin in his absence for my personal use.  As he had the code freely available I have continued that with my updates.

Bukkit plugin - allows players to draw directly onto minecraft maps.

### NOTE
Use a plugin manager to reload your server whenever you update ArtMap - the Spigot reload command will freak out and throw a bunch of exceptions.
