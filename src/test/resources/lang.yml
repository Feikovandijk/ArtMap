# Replace the strings below
# It is recommended you use a yaml-sensitive editor like notepad++ to edit this file
#
# EXAMPLE: “Replace me with a translation!”
#
# Any time you see '%s' - this is a special character that will be replaced with a word.
# For example, if an artist saves an artwork named "Art", then "Successfully saved '%s'"
# will become "Successfully saved Art".
# So any time you see '%s', don't change it! Just change the words around it.
#
# Any time you see "/art", leave that unchanged as well (this is the help command)
#
# Any time you see § next to a number or letter (something like §a or §2), this is a colour code
